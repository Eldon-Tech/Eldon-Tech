## About Me
An aspiring IT Support Specialist with a CompTIA A+ certification and hands-on experience in troubleshooting hardware, software, and network issues.  
Iâ€™m currently earning my Associate of Applied Science in Information Technology and building my skills through home lab projects.  

I enjoy learning how systems connect, supporting users, and finding efficient solutions to everyday technical challenges. My goal is to grow into a System Administrator role while continuing to learn and document my journey here on GitHub.
